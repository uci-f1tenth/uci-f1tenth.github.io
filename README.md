# F1Tenth @ UCI

## Our Mission

Building fast, [small-scale autonomous racing cars](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lbP01VaWrVU) is an exciting challenge that we hope to conquer.

[F1Tenth](https://f1tenth.org/about.html) is an international community of autonomous systems enthusiasts. We are a student-run club aimed at developing machine learning algorithms and building hardware. Our goal is to learn, innovate, and build these systems together to compete in various races throughout the year.

Whether you're a coding genius wonderchild, a hardware nerd, or just curious about autonomous racing, we provide unique opportunities that scratch all itches.

If you are interested in joining or would like to drop by, please [join us on Discord](https://discord.gg/KWENJaPCMK).

## Local Development

### Getting Setup

This repo uses `pnpm`, a space-efficient replacement to `npm`. You can learn more about its advantages at <https://pnpm.io/>.

Install pnpm with the following command, or use an [alternative installation method](https://pnpm.io/installation).

```shell
npm install -g pnpm
```

When running commands, use `pnpm` rather than `npm`.

-   `git clone https://github.com/uci-f1tenth/uci-f1tenth.github.io.git`
-   `cd uci-f1tenth.github.io`
-   `pnpm install`

### Running the Project

-   `pnpm dev`
-   Open [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173) to view it in the browser.
